# Magic Square ACP Course

> Here I wrote a Program which generates Magic squares with any number of rows and colomns so I did cover all Magic squares types like and It randomly change the displayed Magic square if I entered the same rows and more than one time:      

        1. `Odd Magic Squares`.   
        2. `Doubly Even Magic Squares`.   
        3. `Singly Even Magic Squares`.
